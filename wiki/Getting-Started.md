# Getting Started

Welcome to **Laravel Draftable**! This guide will help you get up and running quickly with the most comprehensive drafts and versioning system for Laravel.

## 🎉 What is Laravel Draftable?

**Laravel Draftable** is a production-ready package that adds **drafts**, **versioning**, and **publication workflows** to any Eloquent model. Save changes as drafts, compare versions, restore previous states, and publish when ready - all with 100% test coverage and enterprise-grade quality.

### ✨ **Key Features**
- 📝 **Draft System**: Save changes without publishing immediately
- 🕒 **Version History**: Track all changes over time
- 🔍 **Version Comparison**: See exactly what changed between versions
- ⏪ **Restore Capability**: Go back to any previous version
- 🚀 **Flexible Publishing**: Manual or automatic publication
- 🔒 **Access Control**: Laravel policies integration
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized database queries and indexes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
composer require grazulex/laravel-draftable
```

### 2. Add to Your Model

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Grazulex\LaravelDraftable\Traits\HasDrafts;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasDrafts;
    
    protected $fillable = ['title', 'content', 'status'];
}
```

### 3. Start Using Drafts

```php
// Create a post
$post = Post::create(['title' => 'My First Post']);

// Make changes and save as draft
$post->title = 'Updated Title';
$post->content = 'This is draft content';
$post->saveDraft();

// Publish when ready
$post->publishDraft();

// View draft history
$drafts = $post->drafts;

// Compare versions
$diff = $post->compareDrafts($draft1, $draft2);
```

### 4. Artisan Commands

```bash
# List all drafts
php artisan laravel-draftable:list

# Compare versions
php artisan laravel-draftable:diff Post 1 --versions=1,2
